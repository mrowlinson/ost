# E2E test: verify Trouter WebSocket connection, registration, and message send.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - teams-cli built (cargo build)
#   - Valid login session (teams-cli login)
#
# Usage:
#   ./tests/e2e_trouter.sh
#
# The test:
#   1. Starts trouter listener in background
#   2. Waits for "trouter.connected" event (verifies WS + registrations work)
#   3. Sends a timestamped message to the self-chat (verifies chat API works)
#   4. Optionally waits for the message to arrive via Trouter push
#   5. Reports results
#
# Note: Push notification delivery depends on server-side state and may not
# arrive in dev/test contexts due to accumulated message_loss indicators.
